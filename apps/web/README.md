# Protekt Web (Dashboard)

This is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript frontend scaffold for the Protekt dashboard.

Quick start:
1. cd /Users/aon/Documents/protekt/apps/web
2. pnpm install
3. pnpm dev

Notes:
- The UI is intentionally simple and uses plain CSS to approximate the dashboard
- Replace or extend components with design system / component library as needed.
