## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Agent** (`main.py`): Orchestrates all services
- **Configuration** (`core/config.py`): Centralized config management
- **Database** (`core/database.py`): SQLite database operations
- **Logging** (`core/logger.py`): Structured logging system

### Service Layer
Each service runs in its own thread and provides:
- Start/stop lifecycle management
- Error handling and recovery
- Integration with core systems
- Offline operation support

### Data Flow
1. **Collection**: Services collect data from system
2. **Storage**: Data stored locally in SQLite
3. **Processing**: Anomaly detection and alert generation
4. **Sync**: Offline queue syncs with SaaS backend
5. **Audit**: All actions logged for compliance
